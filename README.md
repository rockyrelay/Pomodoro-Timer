# Georgia's Pomodoro Timer App

As per the end of the FAC 26 Skills Bootcamp, we were tasked with some project-prompts, designed to help us revise the fundamentals we have learnt during the course.

I have chosen to create a Pomodoro Timer. :tomato: 

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. I use pomodoro timers whether I'm studying code, languages, and throughout my career. Time to build one myself!

You can read about the pomodoro technique on Cirillo's site [here](https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique).
